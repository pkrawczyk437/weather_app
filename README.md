Weather App created with react.js
- Here was my first time of fetching some data from the real server,
- I also must notice that OpenWeatherAPI has some bug, so when we search our city + country, which is not belonging to particular country the data will be also returned
- I added also some bootstrap for styling purposes

To test this app you must:
- Download it into your computer/laptop,
- "npm install" in terminal to install required packages
